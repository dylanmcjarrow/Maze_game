# Maze game

Welcome. This is the "Nowhere 'left' to turn" challenge, where your problem solving abilities are tested.
        The objective of the game is to get from one side of the house to the other in order to retrieve the prize.
        In order to get there you must use the given tiles to navigate the course. The course is completed using only
        right turns (yellow tiles), which can be placed on the open tiles (white), and one wall jump (orange tile).
        To place a tile click on the area you want to place it, remove it by clicking on it again. After start is pressed the game will
        begin with the player piece moving upwards. Get the player tile (brown) to the finish tile (blue) to complete the challenge, just note that all moves must be made
        before the game is started. Scoring is based on the amount of moves made, moves cleared and the number of times the player piece gets reset. A lower score is a better score. Good luck.
